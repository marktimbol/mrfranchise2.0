								Mr. Franchise is one of Canada’s most iconic restaurant brands, our doors first opened in 1954. With over 200 restaurant locations across Canada serving up classic, craveable, wholesome food in our dining rooms, through take-out and delivery. Our rotisserie chicken is made fresh on premise every day; it’s slow roasted to perfection and needless to say, it never sees the inside of a freezer. Our fries are hand-cut in our own kitchen from fresh potatoes. Our famous Chalet dipping sauce is simmered on premise daily so you can always be sure it’ll taste as good as you remembered. And our grilled to order ribs are marinated in-house to make them fall off the bone tender. Truth is, at Swiss Chalet you’ll always know your food was made fresh by real people.
